<h1>Moving Around the shell</h1>

<p>First thing is first. Lets figure out where you are at!</p>

<samp>pwd</samp>
<code>C/Users/Alex/</code>

<p>This just printed your current directory. If you just opened your terminal window this should be your home directory</p>

<p>Lets figure out what is in this directory</p>
<samp>ls</samp>
<pre><code>Applications
Creative Cloud Files Desktop
Documents

Google Drive
Library
Movies
Music
Pictures
Public
git
</code></pre>

<p>ls will print the contents of your directory. There are some files that aren't shown. To see these files we can add arguments to our commands</p>
<p>For example we can list all the contents of this directory with</p>
<samp>ls -a</samp>
<pre><code>.
..
.adobe
.bash_alias
.bash_aliases
.bash_history
.bash_it
.bash_profile
.bash_profile.bak
.bash_sessions
.CFUserTextEncoding
.config
.DS_Store
.local
.npm
.oracle_jre_usage
.python_history
.ssh
.Trash
.viminfo
.virtualenvs

<p>The first two directories here are special paths that are in every directory</p>
<p><code>.</code> is the current directory, so to access a hidden file in the directory you would type in <code>.file</code></p>
<p><code>..</code> is the previous directory</p>
<p>To move to the previous directory we would type in <samp>cd ..</samp></p>
<p>There are some shortcuts to some special directories</p>
<p><samp>/</samp> is the root directory of your computer typically the <code>C:/</code> drive on windows machines</p>
<p><samp>~</samp> is your home directory. In windows its typically <code>C:/Users/UserName/</code></p>
<p>Lets move to your git directory by typing in <samp>cd /git/</samp></p>
<p>With <samp>ls</samp> from before we can see all of our git repositories.</p>
<p>There are many more commands that you can use to assist you in the shell. Those can come in a later lesson. This lesson is just the basics to get you moving around and working in git</p>
<h1>Git basics and workflow</h1>
<p>Git is the source control program we use. It is a very powerful tool set that can be used for any project. It allows for easy file revisions and collaboration between many people</p>
<p>To start navigate to the project you have done work in and identify your issue number</p>
<p>We need to make a branch before we start coding so our work can be submitted and reviewed speretly from our working branch which is usually <code>develop</code></p>

<h3>Branch Naming</h3>
<p>For issue number that are 6 places like issue #123456 we use the scheme <code>SP/123000/400/123456</code></p>
<p>For issue number with 5 places like #12345 we use <code>SP/12000/12345</code></p>
<p>For features that don't have an issue number <code>feature/{FirstInital}{LastName}/{distinctFeatureName}</code></p>
<h3>Creating and moving to the branch</h3>
<p><samp>git branch {branch name}</samp> Will create your branch</p>
<p>To move to that branch so you can start coding <samp>git checkout {branch name}</samp></p>
<p>Now that we have our branch go write some code and come back after you have made some progress</p>
<h3>Committing your code</h3>
<p>A commit is how we creates a checkpoint for our code. It saves all the work you have done.</p>
<p>Commits should be done early and often. Think every time you come to a good stopping point.</p>
<p>Commits can also be done to just save your work at the end of the day or whenever you need to work on something else</p>
<p>The first part of the commit is to see the status of your work. For this example we are going to be using the directory of the project this file is in.</p>
<samp>git status</samp>
<pre><code>On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

	MovingAroundTheShell.html
	main.css
	scripts/

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</code></pre>
<p>Here we can see many different things that were output</p>
<p>To start we see</p>
<pre><code>On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.</code></pre>
<p>This is the the current branch you are on. Yours should correspond to the issue you are working on.</p>
<pre><code>Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

	MovingAroundTheShell.html
	main.css
	scripts/</code></pre>
<p>These are new files that were added and are untracked by git</p>
<p>We need to add them with <samp>git add {filename}</samp> or if you want to add them all at once you can use</p>
<samp>git add --all</samp>
<p>Now to see what happened we can use</p>
<samp>git status</samp>
<pre><code>On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

	new file:   MovingAroundTheShell.html
	new file:   main.css
	renamed:    git-safeRebase -> scripts/git-safeRebase
</code></pre>
<p>We see that the files are staged and ready to be committed. If you want to remove a single file you can use <samp>git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;</samp></p>
<p>To reset all of the file you can use <samp>git reset HEAD --mixed</samp></p>
<p><code>HEAD</code> is the current state of your branch</p>
<p>Be very careful with the <code>reset</code> command. You can lose work if you use it wrong</p>
<samp>git commit</samp>
<p>This launched the text editor <code>VIM</code> by default</p>
<p>To write your commit message you must first press the <code>a</code> (amend) or the <code>i</code> (insert) key</p>
<p>Now you can type your commit message out as normal. When you are done hit <code>esc</code> and then type <code>:wq</code> and hit <code>enter</code> to save your commit message</p>
<h3>Getting your code ready to push</h3>
<p>Now that you have completed your code you must get it ready to push to the remote</p>
