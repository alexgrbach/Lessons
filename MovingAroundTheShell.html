	<p>First thing is first. Lets figure out where you are at!</p>
	<samp>pwd</samp>
	<code>C/Users/Alex/</code>
	<p>This just printed your current directory. If you just opened your terminal window this should be your home directory</p>
	<p>Lets figure out what is in this directory</p>
	<h3 id="ListFiles">Listing Files</h3>
	<samp>ls</samp>
	<pre><code>Applications
	Creative Cloud Files Desktop
	Documents
	Downloads
	Google Drive
	Library
	Movies
	Music
	Pictures
	Public
	git
	</code></pre>
	<p>ls will print the contents of your directory. There are some files that aren't shown. To see these files we can add arguments to our commands</p>
	<p>For example we can list all the contents of this directory with</p>
	<samp>ls -a</samp>
	<pre><code>.
	..
	.bash_alias
	.bash_history
	.bash_it
	.bash_profile
	.bash_sessions
	.config
	.ssh
	.viminfo
	Applications
	Desktop
	Documents
	git
	Public</code></pre>
	<p>The first two directories here are special paths that are in every directory</p>
	<p><code>.</code> is the current directory, so to access a hidden file in the directory you would type in <code>.file</code></p>
	<p><code>..</code> is the previous directory</p>
	<h3 id="MovingAround">Moving Around</h3>
	<p><samp>cd</samp> is how we Change Directories</p>
	<p><samp>cd ..</samp> moves up one directory so if you are in <code>/c/git/</code> you will go up a directory to <code>/c/</code></p>
	<p>When filling out paths in the shell you can hit the <code>tab</code> key at any point to attempt to auto complete the path</p>
	<p>For example <samp>cd /c/git/HO/HO.We</samp><code>tab</code> will auto complete to <code>cd /c/git/HO/HO.Weforms/</code></p>
	<h3 id="CreateDirsFiles">Create directories and files</h3>
	<p><samp>touch fileName</samp> will create a file called <code>fileName</code></p>
	<p><samp>mkdir directory</samp> creates a directory named <code>directory</code></p>
	<p>Remember directory and file names are case sensitive</p>
	<h3 id="FileManipulation">File Manipulation</h3>
	<p>we can move files with <samp>mv {fileToMove} {new/path/to/fileToMove}</samp></p>
	<p>copy files with <samp>cp {file} {copiedFile}</samp></p>
	<p>to remove a file use <samp>rm {fileName}</samp></p>
	<h3 id="HelpMenus">Getting help</h3>
	<p>If you need help with any command you can access the help menu for most commands with <samp>{Command Name} --help</samp></p>
	<p>For more information you can open the manual for the command with <samp>man {Command Name}</samp></p>
	<p>Don't forget to try google. There are many useful references online. We are using <code>Bash (Born Again SHell)</code></p>
	<p><samp>rm -rf {directory}</samp>removes a full directory. Be careful with this one because there isn't an easy way to get your stuff back</p>
	
	<h1 id="GitBasics">Git Basics</h1>
	<p>Git is the source control program we use. It is a very powerful tool set that can be used for any project. It allows for easy file revisions and collaboration between many people</p>
	<p>To start navigate to the project you have done work in and identify your issue number</p>
	<p>We need to make a branch before we start coding so our work can be submitted and reviewed separately from our working branch which is usually <code>develop</code></p>
	<h3 id="FirstTimeConfiguration">First Time Configuration</h3>
	<p>We have to setup your name, email, and push behavior</p>
	<p><samp>git config --global user.name "John Doe"</samp></p>
	<p><samp>git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com</samp></p>
	<p><samp>git config --global push.default simple</samp></p>
	<h3 id="BranchNaming">Branch Naming</h3>
	<p>For issue number that are 6 places like issue #123456 we use the scheme <code>SP/123000/400/123456</code></p>
	<p>For issue number with 5 places like #12345 we use <code>SP/12000/12345</code></p>
	<p>For features that don't have an issue number <code>feature/{FirstInital}{LastName}/{distinctFeatureName}</code></p>
	<h3 id="CreateBranch">Creating and moving to the branch</h3>
	<p><samp>git branch {branch name}</samp> Will create your branch</p>
	<p>To move to that branch so you can start coding <samp>git checkout {branch name}</samp></p>
	<p>Now that we have our branch go write some code and come back after you have made some progress</p>
	<h3 id="CommittingCode">Committing your code</h3>
	<p>A commit is how we creates a checkpoint for our code. It saves all the work you have done.</p>
	<p>Commits should be done early and often. Think every time you come to a good stopping point.</p>
	<p>Commits can also be done to just save your work at the end of the day or whenever you need to work on something else</p>
	<p>The first part of the commit is to see the status of your work. For this example we are going to be using the directory of the project this file is in.</p>
	<samp>git status</samp>
	<pre><code>On branch master
	Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

	Untracked files:
	  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

		MovingAroundTheShell.html
		main.css
		scripts/

	no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</code></pre>
	<p>Here we can see many different things that were output</p>
	<p>To start we see</p>
	<pre><code>On branch master
	Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.</code></pre>
	<p>This is the the current branch you are on. Yours should correspond to the issue you are working on.</p>
	<pre><code>Untracked files:
	  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

		MovingAroundTheShell.html
		main.css
		scripts/</code></pre>
	<p>These are new files that were added and are untracked by git</p>
	<p>We need to add them with <samp>git add {filename}</samp> or if you want to add them all at once you can use</p>
	<samp>git add --all</samp>
	<p>Now to see what happened we can use</p>
	<samp>git status</samp>
	<pre><code>On branch master
	Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

	Changes to be committed:
	  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

		new file:   MovingAroundTheShell.html
		new file:   main.css
		renamed:    git-safeRebase -> scripts/git-safeRebase
	</code></pre>
	<p>We see that the files are staged and ready to be committed. If you want to remove a single file you can use <samp>git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;</samp></p>
	<p>To reset all of the file you can use <samp>git reset HEAD --mixed</samp></p>
	<p><code>HEAD</code> is the current state of your branch</p>
	<p>Be very careful with the <code>reset</code> command. You can lose work if you use it wrong</p>
	<samp>git commit</samp>
	<p>This launched the text editor <code>VIM</code> by default</p>
	<p>To write your commit message you must first press the <code>a</code> (amend) or the <code>i</code> (insert) key</p>
	<p>Now you can type your commit message out as normal. When you are done hit <code>esc</code> and then type <code>:wq</code> and hit <code>enter</code> to save your commit message</p>
	<h3 id="GettingReady">Getting your code ready to push</h3>
	<p>Now that you have completed your code you must get it ready to push to the remote</p>
	<p>Since we want to keep our git history nice and clean you should flatten your branch by resetting all the commits on it</p>
	<p>To find out how many commits are on your branch you can use <samp>git cherry develop | wc -l</samp> remember this number for later.</p>
	<p>This will spit out the number of commits you have. It is a combination of two commands piped with the output of <code>git cherry develop</code> piped into <code>wc -l</code></p>
	<p><samp>git cherry develop</samp> compares your branch to develop and will show you the ids of all your commits.</p>
	<p><samp>wc -l</samp> counts the lines in taken from an input. This is a generic tool you can use anywhere.</p>
	<p>With the number from above you can now reset the branch with <samp>git reset HEAD~</samp><code>{number from earlier}</code></p>
	<p>Now restage and commit your code</p>
	<h3 id="Rebase">Rebasing</h3>
	<p>Now we need to get our code up to date with the current state of develop</p>
	<p>We do this with a rebase</p>
	<p>First thing is first. Chekout to develop with <samp>git checkout develop</samp> and then pull to get latest <samp>git pull</samp></p>
	<p>Now check back out to the branch you were working on <samp>git checkout {branchName}</samp></p>
	<p><samp>git rebase develop</samp> will move your branch forward in time so it includes the changes in the most recent code</p>
	<p>You can do this at anytime especially when you need new features that have been merged into develop.</p>
	<p>There might be merge conflicts. Don't be worried just go find each one and fix it. Once done restage your files with <samp>git add --all</samp> and then continue the rebase with <samp>git rebase --continue</samp></p>
	<p>DO NOT rebase if your code has already been pushed to develop</p>
	<h3 id="Pushing">Pushing your code to origin</h3>
	<p>It is time to get our code onto the remote server</p>
	<p>We do this with <samp>git push -u</samp> the <code>-u</code> is only needed the first time you push since its sets up tracking from the upstream branch</p>
